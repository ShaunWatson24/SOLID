# SOLID
A solution of simple examples of each of the five SOLID principles with unit tests.

# Disclaimer
I am aware that each subsequent example may violate one of the other principles somewhat therefore each example should be treated in isolation.

# Use
Feel free to use these examples to get a better grasp of the SOLID principles in .NET.

# Sources
In places, I have emulated similar examples from the web within this solution (e.g. The AreaCalculator is a common example of the OCP)
